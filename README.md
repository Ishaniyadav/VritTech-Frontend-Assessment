# 🎯 Frontend Intern Task – Vrit Technologies

This repository contains my submission for the **Frontend Intern Assessment** by **Vrit Technologies**. The task was to replicate provided UI designs using **HTML & CSS**, and implement a **basic visual animation** using **JavaScript**.

---

## 🖼️ Project Overview

This project includes the implementation of a visually engaging UI section and a simple animation as part of the assignment.

- 🔹 **UI Layout (Four-Card Informational Section):**  
  Recreated a four-part layout consisting of **colorful information cards**. Each card includes:
  - A bold heading (e.g., *Start with Clarity*)
  - A paragraph of explanatory text
  - A matching illustration
  - Distinct background color and rounded corners  
  This section was built entirely using **semantic HTML** and **modular CSS**, mimicking the original design as closely as possible with attention to layout and spacing.

- 🔹 **Grid-Based Animation:**  
  Built a simple grid-based animation using **vanilla JavaScript**. This animation dynamically highlights squares in a pattern using DOM manipulation and `setInterval`, demonstrating interaction logic and timing control.
